    <h2 id="about-h">About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a computer scientist and mathematician who enjoys tackling challenging problems across combinatorics,
      graph theory, geometry, optimization, data structures & algorithms, computer graphics/vision, and automated
      reasoning (SAT/SMT) with formal verification. More recently I focus on IT securityâ€”post-quantum cryptography
      (PQC), elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), and privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs).
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to work with HPC clusters and real-time systems, develop new solution approaches by creatively combining
      (1) classical mathematical proof methods, (2) modern computer-science techniques such as computer-algebra
      systems and SAT/SMT solvers, and (3) compute resources from cluster/HPC environments. 
      This interplay has been
      decisive for breakthroughs on long-standing open problems.
